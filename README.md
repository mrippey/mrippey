### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**mrippey/mrippey** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Mike ([@nahamike01](https://twitter.com/nahamike01)). Everything you see here is a work in progress as new ideas pop into my head. I will try to maintain and update all my repos, but no promises.

My interests include malware & network traffic analysis, detection engineering (Snort, Sigma), threat intelligence, and adversary infrastructure tracking through analyzing domains and IP addresses.

I enjoy creating scripts to automate parts of my research that are quite monotonous. My hopes are to one day work in cybersecurity, either as an analyst, or junior developer authoring Blue Team focused tools.

About me ...

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... too many side projects to count or try to list here. It seems like I find a new project daily.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... anything
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... Twitter, but give me time to respond please.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... I have been living in Japan for about 10 years.
